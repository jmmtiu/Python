# Python

PathNodes.py
- Uses the Project OSMR route service to generate a list of nodes along a given set of coordinates that gives the most optimal route.
- It then generates  a lat,lon coordinate list for the path using the Overpass API.
- Next, it populates distant nodes based on a maximum distance.
- It also plots the path to visualize the output.
